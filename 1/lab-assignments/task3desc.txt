The program outputs the values that have been loaded into the register $a0. The syscall command looks
at the $v0 register for a command number, in the first case it is a 4 which is the command for print_string,
and in the second case, it is 10, which signals the program to exit. The value loaded into the register is
defined in msg under the .data directive which is then used as an argument to the first syscall.
