    "Remeber propositional logic in AI? Well this is where it came from dude. BOOLEAN ALGEBRA. There are three operations which we have to worry about when it comes to arithmetizing booleans (True and False). These operations are AND (•), OR (+), and NOT (~) why not ¬ ? That's what they use with the propositional logic stuff in AI. \n",
    "\n",
    "**AND**: T • T = T because both terms are True. T • F = F because one term is false, therefore the whole expression is not True. F • T = F && F • F = F. \n",
    "\n",
    "**OR**: T + T = F because both terms are True. T + F = T && F + T = T because one of the terms is true therefore one or the other is true. F + F = F since there is not truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOT**: ~T = F && ~F = T. Pretty straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make truth tables for each operation (look at module 1.44 for an example). IT'S MODEL CHECKING DUDE. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these basic operators, we can make new ones such as XOR (exclusive OR which is denoted as a circle holowed out with a plus sign), NAND, and NOR. \n",
    "\n",
    "**XOR**: F * T = T && T * F = T because 1 of the terms is true exclusive of the other. F * F = F && T * T = F because either one or the other is true and not both, otherwise, it's false. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Practice</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Just make some truth tables on some paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTs are implemented in a pretty cool way. You give the current two paths to follow (1 goes to ground through the transistor and the other is the default path of least resistance). When you turn the control wire on, the default path is negated and the current flows to ground and vice versa. Tah-dah, you made a NOT circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "ANDs take TWO inputs and produce a single output. Two sequential transistors on the same wire. If both are on then current can flow through otherwise, all other combos are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTs also take in two inputs but one wire splits into two different ones where transistors are and then join back after the transistors. That way, if either of the transistors is on, then we get output. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do computers handle a lot of conditionals though? Like what is you have A || B || C, or (A && B && C) || (D && E && F)? Seems like you just abstract out and then put it together.\n",
    "\n",
    "XORs are a bit weird, their only true when one part is true exclusively i.e. if you have this OR that but NOT both. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bit values of 0 represent false while 1's represent true."

    "Subtraction is meaningless in boolean algebra since the only numbers allowed are 0 and 1 which therefore makes division (a variation of subtraction) impossible. Your plus symbol (+) is an OR, your multiplication symbol (x) is an AND, and the complement of a variable is just a bar over the head as well as the number your variable is NOT i.e. 1 is not 0 so 1's compliment is 0 and vice versa. \n",
